# About CPUchain

### A Peer-to-Peer Digital Finance Platform

CPUchain aims to inherit and enhance the vision of Bitcoin as P2P transmitter without centralized authority and Ethereum as World Computer that could run ungoverned Digital Finance Applications.

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution - Bitcoin Whitepaper

> A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform - Ethereum Whitepaper

By building a blockchain execution program, or so-called ***Full-Node***, with a built-in Virtual Machine that can run fully fledged Turing-complete Smart Contract language **Solidity**, and with a CPU-intensive Proof-of-Work block building consensus based on **[yespower hashing algorithm](https://www.openwall.com/yespower/)** we aim to fulfill as a trustless, ungoverned non-custodial peer-to-peer transaction settlement layer 1 network.
