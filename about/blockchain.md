CPUchain constructs a P2P Blockchain network where it accumulates every transaction and its verification/execution data with a unit called Blocks.

Selective random parties that run full nodes ( for Proof-of-Work consensus using nodes like Bitcoin or CPUchain, we call them miners; for Proof-of-Stake consensus using nodes like Ethereum, it is called validators ) verify and include user transactions to blocks.

And after some period of time, which is considered to be irreversible to revert published Blocks, transactions are considered final, and every full-node should be able to download, verify, and reconstruct blocks on their local computer to see if the blockchain network is deterministic and built by a trustless process.

CPUchain uses specialized, optimized processes to select miners, construct blocks, store blocks, and load historic blocks to use them on onboarded financial applications.
