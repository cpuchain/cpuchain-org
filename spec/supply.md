# CPU Supply

::: info
There is an increase of Total Supply from 105M CPU to 202M CPU when migrated from BTC fork to EVM chain, to guarantee stable inflation of CPU mining rewards & to give a fair chance to later participants of the network.
:::

::: warning
Mining rewards on BTC-fork chain (classic chain) are permanently disabled and only 91M CPU would be issued on BTC-fork chain in total.
